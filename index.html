            <h1>Professional Summary</h1>
            <p>I am an emerging tech professional with a background in philosophy, where I developed strong analytical
                reasoning, structured problem-solving, and communication skills. My transition into the technology field
                has been driven by curiosity and practical engagement with digital systems, device management, email
                platforms, and user-support tools. Over time, I have gained experience navigating frontend and backend
                concepts, client-server interactions, and general IT workflows. My blend of philosophical training and
                technical exposure enables me to think critically, learn fast, and approach challenges with clarity and
                creativity. I am actively building deeper technical expertise while positioning myself to contribute
                meaningfully within the growing African tech landscape.</p>
